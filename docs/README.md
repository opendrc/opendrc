# Developer Guide

## Design Philosophy

OpenDRC is an open-source design rule checker that supports GPU acceleration.
Initial project targets include 
- Support of GDSII
- Support of advanced rule decks (e.g., ASAP7, FreePDK45)
- Support of hierarchical layout designs
- Support of GPU acceleration
- Extreme usability and extensibility

## Code Organization

### Logical organization
From top to bottom, OpenDRC consists of the following layers:
- Interface: IO, DB adaptor, function APIs
- Application: algorithm scheduling
- Algorithm: core algorithms, where GPU kernels are launched
- Infrastructure: abstract data structures and algorithms, utilities, GPU libraries

In general, higher layers depend on the abstraction of lower layers, but not the other way round.

### Physical (file) organization
OpenDRC basically follows the [canonical project structure](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html#tests-unit) proposal, except that unittests are also placed in the `/test` folder.
Specifically, header files (`\*.hpp`) and source files (`\*.cpp`) are placed next to each other in the same folder (i.e., no `/include` and `/src` split!).

```
OpenDRC
+-- docs
+-- examples
+-- odrc
    +-- gdsii
        +-- gdsii.cpp
        +-- gdsii.hpp
    +-- main.cpp
+-- tests
    +-- gdsii
        +-- gdsii.test.cpp
    +-- main.cpp
+-- thirdparty
    +-- doctest
        +-- doctest.h
```

In CMake, `target_include_directories` have been configured to include the project root folder (`OpenDRC/`) and the third-party folder (`OpenDRC/thirdparty`).
Therefore, to include a header file, use
```c++
#include <odrc/gdsii/gdsii.hpp>

#include <doctest/doctest.h>
```

## Building
OpenDRC uses CMake to automatically generate build system.
The standard way to build the project is as following:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Test
OpenDRC organizes unit-tests with *doctest*.
To execute tests after successfully building, run
```bash
./tests/tests
```

## Development Workflow

### GitHub Flow
We adopt the GitHub flow (but not the git flow) for its simplicity, which better supports agile development.
Every change should be merged to the main repository by pull request.
In other words, a typical work flow consists of the following steps:

0. (do only once) Fork the repository, clone to local
1. Pull upstream updates
2. Checkout to a new branch, e.g., `feat/gdsii`
3. Code, code, code, ...
4. Commit to the forked repo
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch
6. (after PR accepted) delete the merged branch


### Git commit message
A standard git commit message is as the following:
```
<type>(scope): <subject>
```

where type is one of the following:
- feat: add new feature
- fix: fix program bug(s)
- test: modify testing files
- perf: tune performance
- docs: update documentation
- chore: build system etc.
- style: only change style, not code logic
- refactor: code refactor
- revert: revert to previous version

scope is where the change takes place, and subject is a short summary of the commit.
The summary should use imperative verb form (i.e., present simple tense), avoid unnecessary capticalization, and not ended with punctuation.
In general the summary should fit in the following sentence:

> “If applied, my commit will (INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE TEXT)”

Whether to have more detailed description is up to the developer.
Here is a commit message example:
```
feat(iterface/gdsii): add parser for gdsii record header
```

## Coding Style
OpenDRC uses *snake_case* for naming variables, functions, and classes, which follows the naming convention in STL.

A `.clang-format` file is provided in the project root directory for automatic formatting.
It is based on the *Chromium* style (due to random reasons).
